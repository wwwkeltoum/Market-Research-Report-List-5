<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ring Type Joint Flanges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded</li><li>Slip-On</li><li>Welding Neck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ring Type Joint (RTJ) flanges are categorized into three main types based on their connection methods: Threaded, Slip-On, and Welding Neck. Threaded flanges feature internal threads, allowing them to be screwed onto pipe ends, making installation easy but limiting pressure ratings. Slip-On flanges slip over the pipe, offering a cost-effective solution with moderate strength; however, alignment can be challenging. Welding Neck flanges provide superior strength through a welded connection, ideal for high-pressure applications, ensuring a robust and leak-resistant seal.</p></p>
