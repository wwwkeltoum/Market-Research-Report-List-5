<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Feed Protease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endopeptidase</li><li>Exopeptidase</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The animal feed protease market is segmented into endopeptidases, exopeptidases, and other types. Endopeptidases act on peptide bonds within protein molecules, breaking them down into shorter chains and enhancing protein digestibility. Exopeptidases, on the other hand, cleave amino acids from the ends of peptide chains, facilitating further protein absorption. Other protease types include specialized enzymes that serve specific functions in feed formulations. Together, these proteases improve nutrient availability and animal growth performance in livestock and aquaculture industries.</p></p>
