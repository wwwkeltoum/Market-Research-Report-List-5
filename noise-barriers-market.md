<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective type</li><li>Absorptive type</li><li>Mixed type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noise barriers are categorized into three main types based on their construction and function. Reflective type barriers deflect sound waves away from sensitive areas, making them effective in high-noise environments. Absorptive type barriers, on the other hand, diminish noise by absorbing sound energy, ideal for reducing echo in urban settings. Mixed type barriers combine reflective and absorptive materials, offering a balanced solution for both deflection and absorption, catering to diverse noise reduction needs in various applications.</p></p>
