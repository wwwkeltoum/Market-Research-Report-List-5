<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Replacement Implants (Knee prosthesis) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Bearing Implants</li><li>Mobile-Bearing Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knee replacement implants, or knee prostheses, are categorized into two primary types: fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing implants. Fixed-bearing implants feature a non-moving design, providing stability and durability, making them a common choice for many patients. In contrast, mobile-bearing implants allow for rotational movement, which can simulate natural knee function and may reduce wear on the prosthesis. Each type has distinct benefits, with choices depending on patient needs, activity levels, and surgeon preferences, ultimately influencing recovery and long-term outcomes.</p></p>
